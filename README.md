# python-packages
In this repo I demonstrates modules and packages.
First of all I created 2 files the first file will be just a utility file (library) that contains a list of functions.
In the second file I will be importing the function I created in the firest file using one of the commands.
Then, I downloaded one of python packages called (colorama) in a sub folder called "my_venv” using the command  py – m venv your-venv-name.
I activate the folder using the command your-venv-name\Scripts\activate.
I installed (colorama) using the command pip install colorama
and finally I import the package (colorama) into my main python file.
